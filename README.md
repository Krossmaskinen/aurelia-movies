# Movie fetch

Make sure you have node and npm installed. To set up the app follow the steps below:

1. Run

    `npm install`
2. Run

    `jspm install`

Now you can run the app using the npm module *http-server* using this command:

`http-server -o -c-1`

-o opens the served page in the browser, and -c-1 disables cache (for development purposes).
You can also run the app using express if you have it installed:

`node server.js`
